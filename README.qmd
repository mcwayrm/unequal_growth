---

This repository houses the code to estimate the unequal growth project. Below is a brief structure of the files. Eventually, we will likely want to turn this into an R package called `unequalgrowth`. The data is housed seperately.


# Adapting Glewwe 2014

This is the original Glewwe 2014 scripts and adaptations to run a simple modification adding variance and inequality measures to the determinants of growth. 


# Cleaning Data 

These the scripts to clean the data used for an expansion of the analysis


# Determinants of Growth 

Scripts to estimate impact of determinants on growth 


# Forecasting

Given the factors that influence growth, project future growth with these considerations and compare them to projects without considering inequality measures.
